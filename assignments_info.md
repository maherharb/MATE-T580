# Assignments

There will be assignments that are due every other week. That is a total of five assignments over the duration of the course. These assignments are more like challenges. They are intended to get you to apply the techniques you learn in class and on DataCamp to relevant problems that use real datasets. 

The details of the assignments will be released in the assignments folder sequentially (as pdf files). Each file will thoroughly describe the task at hand and how to access the required dataset(s) (if any). Hand in the solution by emailing the script(s) to the instructor by the due date. The name of the file should be **Assignmentx_last_first.R**, where *x* is the assignment number and *last* and *first* are the student's last and first name. The .Rmd (journal) format is also accepted. 

The following table contains a brief description of the assignments and the due dates:

The criteria for getting a full grade on the assignment is different for each assignment. However, one criterion in common is to hand in a working solution that is:

- **Easy to run on my machine**: requires changing no more than a single line of code (the work directory path).

- **Easy to follow**: code includes comments, indentation is used to structure the code for ease of readability, etc.

- **Your own work**: collaboration with classmates is not allowed. However, you can search through web resources such as stackoverflow and copy, paste, and adapt pieces of code that might be useful to you.
