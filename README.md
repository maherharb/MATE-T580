Welcome to MATE-T580 course portal! This repository will serve as the home page for the course. Lectures, assignments, datasets for analysis, and solutions to assignments & quizzes will be posted here. Your first order of business should be to carefully read this page to learn about the course's content, structure, and week-by-week plan of study.  

## Overview
MATE-T580 is designed as an introduction to data science for students with no prior knowledge of the subject. ***MATE-T580 covers all steps of the data science pipeline***: from getting and cleaning data, to performing exploratory analysis, producing meaningful visualizations, all the way to building predictive models. Students will be introduced to some of the most powerful machine learning algorithms used in the industry, including artificial neural network (ANN) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Throughout the course, emphasis will be on the practical aspects of data science (as opposed to the theoretical/statistical aspect). Students will work with real datasets and will do a lot of coding using R. 

## Prerequisites
Some knowledge of R is required before taking the course. To start with, I suggest completing the following courses on DataCamp:
- [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (4 hours, Free)
- [Intermediate R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r) (6 hours, Premium content)

And this interactive course within R:
- [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html)

Note that Drexel students who are registered for the course will receive a special invitation for accessing premium content on DataCamp to complete the prerequisites. ***When signing up for DataCamp, use your Drexel shortname email*** so that your account can be linked to your Drexel identity.   

## Course structure
At its core, Data Science is a combination of coding and performing statistical analysis. As the focus of the course is on the R implementation of various Data Science techniques, you learn best through hands on coding projects. As such, the course is structured to ensure that students complete ~100 hours of coding over the 10-week duration of the course. This is achieved through the following components:
- ***Classroom-lab hybrid***: Classroom time will be run as a lab rather than a traditional lecture. Students are required to always have a laptop with R and Rstudio installed on, ready to use in class. The instructor will present certain concepts and the students will follow by working on related coding tasks. Within this environment, I expect that we'll have lots of stimulating discussions and opportunities to collaborate.
- ***Weekly DataCamp assignments*** (~4 hours each): A blend of mini video lectures and guided hands on exercises. The topics closely follow the topics we learn in class and thus reinforce in-class learning and provide additional avenue for getting hands on practice in R.
- ***Bi-weekly assignments***: More challenging [assignments](assignments_info.md) using real datasets. These assignments test the students ability to apply their subject knowledge to a problem with little guidance (relative to the DataCamp exercises and the in-class activities). The assignments present an opportunity to do work at the level expected in an actual professional setting.
- ***Capstone project***: The capstone project provides a chance for students to perform analysis on a dataset of their own choosing. The analysis should include an advanced topic that was not covered in class. A list of potential topics is included [here](project_info.md), but students are welcome to come up with a topic not included in the list (subject to approval of the course instructor). The deliverable is a 10-minute presentation followed by a Q&A session during the last week of the course.

## About the Instructor

I'm an [Assistant Professor of Physics](http://drexel.edu/materials/contact/faculty/harb/) at Drexel University. I have interest in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Text Mining, and prior consulting experience in these fields. I am also an avid competitor on Kaggle with the rank of Competitions Master. 

## Credit

The lessons of this course are for the most part original material that I developed specifically for the first offering of MATE-T580 at Drexel University. There is one notable exception: lesson 5 on Introduction to Statistical Learning borrows heavily from the book with same name by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. 

The datasets used in the various demos and assignments were collected from different sources on the Internet and placed in a single folder for convenience to students. The datasets and scripts are used for sole educational purposes. 

Educators interested in obtaining the .Rmd files used to create the lessons should contact me with their request. 

## <a name="footnotes"></a>Footnotes

1. To avoid any confusion over the term "University", I adot Robert M. Pirsig definition of the term as quoted from "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance":
   
"The real University, he said, has no specific location. It owns no property, pays no salaries and receives no material dues. The real University is a state of mind. It is that great heritage of rational thought that has been brought down to us through the centuries and which does not exist at any specific location. It's a state of mind which is regenerated throughout the centuries by a body of people who traditionally carry the title of professor, but even that title is not part of the real University. The real University is nothing less than the continuing body of reason itself.

In addition to this state of mind, 'reason,' there's a legal entity which is unfortunately called by the same name but which is quite another thing. This is a nonprofit corporation, a branch of the state with a specific address. It owns property, is capable of paying salaries, of receiving money and of responding to legislative pressures in the process.

But this second university, the legal corporation, cannot teach, does not generate new knowledge or evaluate ideas. It is not the real University at all. It is just a church building, the setting, the location at which conditions have been made favorable for the real church to exist."
